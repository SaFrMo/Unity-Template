# The SaFrMo Template #

The SaFrMo template collects some of the most useful plugins and utility functions I've put together as a Unity developer. These are tools that I find myself importing on just about every project, so making them a public repo seems to be a good way to save myself and others some time in the future.

### How do I use it? ###
1. Create a new Unity project at your target destination.
2. Download the latest .zip of the SaFrMo template.
3. Unzip the downloaded file to your new Unity project's root folder.
4. Rename the 'Template' names as necessary.

### What's included? ###
* **iTween**, the fantastic tweening and animation library [(link)](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/84)
* **iTweenHinting**, which enables hinting for iTween methods and parameters [(link)](http://blog.almostlogical.com/2010/09/13/itween-parameter-code-hinting/)
* **SaFrMo**, a collection of utility functions I've put together during different projects
* **StringEncryption**, which enables basic string encryption and decyrption given an arbitrary key (**not** meant for security purposes, but instead as a deterrent to modifiying save files, dialogue assets, etc)
* **MenuRefresher**, a utility class to auto-populate UI menus (see file for instructions)

### Wish List ###
* A utility to create tooltips. Include tooltip text, prefab path or prefab GameObject, target screen position or Transform, and default lifetime for tooltips and/or confirmation/exit button text
